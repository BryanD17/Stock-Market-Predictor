Predicting linear regression model
1) Intro
Dataset information and why you chose it:
We are currently in the process of developing a stock prediction model for Rivian stock. This model aims to forecast the future price movements of Rivian stock, predicting whether it will rise or decline in the near future.
To begin this endeavor, our first step involved sourcing the necessary stock data for Rivian and converting it into a CSV file for seamless integration into our code. As Rivian operates in the automotive industry, we also acquired stock data for its prominent competitors, namely Tesla and Nio. Similar CSV files were created for these companies to enable a comparative analysis. By leveraging this data and employing advanced analytical techniques, we aim to create a robust prediction model that will assist investors and stakeholders in making informed decisions regarding Rivian stock. Our ultimate goal is to provide valuable insights into the potential future performance of Rivian in the stock market.

2) Exploratory Analysis
Types of Variables:
Within our project, we employed a variety of dictionaries to effectively manage and organize our data. Additionally, we incorporated several diverse libraries to facilitate Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, enabling us to work with and analyze human language effectively.

Descriptive statistics
To analyze the dispersion of stock prices for Rivian, Tesla, and Nio, we employ descriptive statistics, specifically the standard deviation.
This measures the variation within each company's stock prices. We gather recent historical stock price data for the three companies and calculate their respective means. Then, we find the differences between each stock price and its mean, square these differences, and average them to compute the variance.
Finally, we take the square root of the variance to obtain the standard deviation. This metric reveals how far apart each company's stock prices are from their mean, indicating volatility or stability. By following this process, we can determine the recent price performance of Rivian, Tesla, and Nio in the market.

Plots
To analyze ongoing trends in the recent stock prices of Rivian, Tesla, and Nio, we'll use scatter plots—an essential data visualization tool in computer science. By plotting the stock prices against time, we can easily identify patterns and trends. An upward slope suggests increasing prices; a downward slope indicates decreasing prices; and scattered data points imply volatility or no clear trend. This visual analysis provides valuable insights for making informed investment decisions.

3) Models: Inferences
Statistical Models used
To analyze and identify trends in the stock prices of Rivian, Tesla, and Nio, we use linear regression—a statistical technique in computer science. By fitting a straight line to each company's stock price data over time, we can determine the trend and direction of their prices. Positive slopes indicate increasing prices, negative slopes suggest declining prices, and flat lines represent stability. Linear regression allows for accurate plotting and data-driven decision-making in financial analysis and investment strategies.

Algorithm -
To perform the analysis, we utilized a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm, a powerful tool in the field of natural language understanding and processing. This algorithm was applied to interpret and process textual data, specifically financial news articles and reports related to Rivian, Tesla, and Nio.

Data Collection: The NLP algorithm collects financial news articles and reports from various sources, encompassing recent data related to the stock prices of Rivian, Tesla, and Nio.
4) Conclusion/Discussion
By integrating the NLP algorithm into the analysis, we can effectively process and extract valuable insights from vast amounts of textual data, enhancing the accuracy and depth of our understanding of the stock performance of Rivian, Tesla, and Nio. This advanced data processing methodology empowers us to make informed investment decisions and derive actionable intelligence from complex financial information in the domain of computer science and natural language processing.
